## 1. Description

This COSY INFINITY code computes the differential-algebrain (DA) transfer map of electrostatic spherical and cylindrical deflectors in a laboratory coordinate system. In case of the electrostatic spherical deflector, two conventional methods are used: (1) integrating the ODEs of motion using a 4th order Runge-Kutta integrator and (2) computing analytically and in closed form the properties of the respective elliptical orbits from Kepler theory. Only the former method is used for the electrostatic cylindrical deflector, as Kepler theory is inapplicable in this case.

The program contains the test cases from the following report:
